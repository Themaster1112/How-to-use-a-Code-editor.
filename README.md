# How-to-use-a-Code-editor.
This will explain how to use a code editor.
Firstly for beggineers I would use visual studio code and i would recommend a windows based PC. To install it go to the microsoft store
and download visual studio code. After it downloaded find the market place icon and search up python. And download it. Then go to python.org
And download python 3.13 then run the set up. Then when it finished go to select interpreter and select python 3.13
